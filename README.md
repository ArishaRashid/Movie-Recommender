# Movie Recommender System

This project is a movie recommender system built with Python, leveraging Jupyter as the integrated development environment (IDE). The goal of this system is to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and behavior, enhancing the user's movie-watching experience.

## Overview

A movie recommender system uses various algorithms and techniques to suggest movies to users based on their historical preferences, ratings, and viewing habits. This project implements a collaborative filtering approach to recommend movies to users by analyzing their interactions with the movie database.

## Features

- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: The system recommends movies by identifying users with similar preferences and suggesting movies that those similar users have enjoyed.

- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies by finding similarities between movies and suggesting other movies that are closely related.

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Utilizes movie attributes such as genres, actors, directors, and keywords to recommend similar movies based on content.

- **Hybrid Filtering**: Combines multiple recommendation approaches to provide more accurate and diverse movie suggestions.
